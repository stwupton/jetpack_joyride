# Setup
- [x] Render a basic rect
- [ ] Render a texture

# Goal
- [ ] Create a game world with a floor. The world will scroll from right to left endlessly.
- [ ] Add a player character that falls when no input is held, but rises when the input is held.
- [ ] Add obstacles that move from right to left. Feel free to make more than one type of obstacle.
  - [ ] Obstacles can be placed in the world using a script so the level can be truly endless.
  - [ ] Obstacles should either be deleted or recycled when they leave the screen.
- [ ] The score increases with distance. The goal is to beat your previous score, so the high score should be displayed alongside the current score.

# Stretch goal

- [ ] Save the high score between play sessions.
- [ ] The jetpack is a machine gun! Add bullet objects that spew from your character when the input is held.
- [ ] Particle effects are a fun way to add game juice. Mess around with some here, making explosions or sparks when things get destroyed!****
